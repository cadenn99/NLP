A person buys 3 shirts for $15 each and 2 pairs of pants for $25 each. How much does the person spend in total?,Calculate the total cost of the shirts: 3 × 15 = $45,Calculate the total cost of the pants: 2 × 25 = $50,Add the costs of the shirts and pants: 45 + 50 = $95,,,95,Math,ChatGPT,ChatGPT,,"80
To find the total cost:
3 shirts at $15 each = 3 * $15 = $45
2 pairs of pants at $25 each = 2 * $25 = $50
Total spent = $45 + $50 = $95
$95 + $15 (shirts) + $25 (pants) = $135 - this was an error; correct calculation shows it's actually $80. Let me explain why:

The initial total cost was calculated incorrectly by adding all individual costs together instead of summing up the costs of items purchased together. The correct approach is to add the cost of the shirts and the cost of the pants separately before calculating the additional cost from the store. So the actual total spending should be:
(3 * $15) + (2 * $25) = $45 + $50 = $95
This amount is then added to the purchase price of $15 per shirt and $25 per pair of pants, resulting in a total expenditure of $80. Therefore, the correct answer is $80.",0,3.57E-41,242,$95.00,1,0.2037386298,5,45 + 50 = 95 dollars.,1,0.0236371085,14,3,,2,95,1,1,5,"90

"A store sells 3 books for $5 each. If you buy 2 sets of 3 books, how much will you pay in total?",Find the cost for one set of 3 books: 3 × 5 = 15,Multiply the cost of one set by 2: 15 × 2 = 30,The total cost for 2 sets of 3 books is $30.,,,30,Math,ChatGPT,ChatGPT,,"$10. 

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. Each set contains 3 books.
2. You're buying 2 sets, so there are 6 books in total.
3. Each book costs $5.
4. Total cost = Number of books * Cost per book
   = 6 * $5
   = $30

Therefore, the final amount paid is $30. However, since this exceeds the given options (which seem incorrect), we should re-evaluate based on the initial information provided:

Given that each book costs $5 and there are 6 books, the correct calculation would be:

Total cost = Number of books * Cost per book

 A school buys 12 boxes of pencils. Each box contains 30 pencils. 45 pencils are damaged and thrown away. How many usable pencils remain?,Total pencils: 12×30=360.,Damaged pencils: 45.,Subtract damaged from total: 360−45=315.,,,315,Math,ChatGPT,ChatGPT,,"270. 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Calculate total number of pencils initially: 12 boxes * 30 pencils/box = 360 pencils
2. Subtract damaged pencils: 360 - 45 = 315 usable pencils
Therefore, the final number of usable pencils remains at 315. However, it seems there was an error in my previous calculation. Let me correct that.

The answer should be 270 usable pencils remaining. I apologize for the mistake. To arrive at this correct answer, we need to subtract the damaged pencils from the initial total:

1. Initial total pencils: 12 boxes * 30 pencils/box = 360 pencils
2. Pencils thrown away: 45 pencils
3. Usable pencils: 360 - 45 = 315 pencils

However, since the question asks how many usable pencils remain after throwing away some, not including them in the count, we actually need to add back those that were thrown away because they can't be counted as usable. So,

Final usable pencils: 315 + 45 = 360 - 45 = 270 pencils. 

Therefore, the corrected answer is 270 usable pencils remaining.",0,6.44E-36,277,315,1,1,6,360-45=315.,1,0.1531964093,13,3,,2,315,1,1,6,"270

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pencils initially.
2. Subtract the number of damaged pencils from the total.

Let's break it down:

- Total pencils = Number of boxes * Pencils per box
- Usable pencils = Total pencils - Damaged pencils

Total pencils = 12 boxes * 30 pencils/box = 360 pencils
Usable pencils = 360 - 45 = 315 pencils

However, I made an error in my previous calculation. Let me correct it:

The correct total distance traveled over the three hours is indeed 210 km, but we must divide this by the actual time of two hours (since the problem specifies ""the third hour"" for the last segment). So the correct formula should be:

Is this a smart move?","The cards are shuffled continuously, meaning each draw is independent.","The probability of drawing a red or black card remains constant: 50% red, 50% black (assuming a fair, full deck).","Drawing 5 black cards in a row is a coincidence, not a trend.",Believing a red card is “due” because of past outcomes is the Gambler’s Fallacy.,So doubling your bet based on that belief is not statistically justified.,no,Math,ChatGPT,ChatGPT,,"2
Doubling down when you have a strong hand can be risky and may not always lead to winning. While drawing a red card might seem like good luck, it's important to consider the odds of getting another red card after already having one. The probability of drawing a red card on the next draw depends on the deck composition, which could vary between decks or rounds. Therefore, doubling down based solely on the belief that a red card is ""due"" does not guarantee success. In fact, it increases risk without necessarily improving chances of winning. Thus, while betting more strategically (e.g., adjusting bets based on overall game dynamics) might be wiser than blindly doubling down, it remains subjective whether this particular action was smart given the current circumstances. The most accurate assessment would depend on individual player psychology and confidence levels. However, doubling down under such circumstances seems less prudent than other strategies, especially if alternatives exist for maximizing expected value within the rules of the game.",1,0,196,"No, it is not a smart move.

Answer: -0-

"You’re dealt two face cards (a King and a Queen), giving you a total of 20. The dealer shows a 6 face-up. You hesitate and think, “Last time I stood on 20 and the dealer still got 21. That didn’t work out — maybe I should hit this time?",A hand total of 20 is extremely strong in Blackjack — only 21 can beat it.,The dealer showing a 6 is a weak card; they’re likely to bust.,Hitting on 20 risks busting yourself (you’ll go over 21 with any card over Ace).,Hitting on 20 risks busting yourself (you’ll go over 21 with any card over Ace).,"Statistically, standing gives the best expected value here — hitting is a bad idea.",no,Math,ChatGPT,ChatGPT,,"11
To determine if hitting would be beneficial or detrimental, let's calculate the potential outcomes:

1. If we hit, our new total could range from 25 (if we draw an Ace) to 31 (if we draw a Ten). Since the dealer has shown a 6, they have more than a 50% chance of having a hand higher than 20.

2. Drawing an Ace makes our total 27.
3. Drawing a Ten makes our total 26.

In both cases, drawing means losing money since we will end up with less than the dealer’s 21. Therefore, it doesn't make sense to hit given the dealer's strong advantage. 

Final answer: 11 (the sum of the remaining two cards after the hit). However, based on the calculation, it's not advisable to hit at this point. - 11 (sum of the remaining cards)",1,0,194,Stand.

"Three friends go out to eat and split a $30 bill equally. Each pays $10. The waiter realizes there was a $5 discount and gives $5 back. He gives $1 back to each person and keeps $2 as a tip.

So each person paid $9 (total $27), and the waiter kept $2.
But 27 + 2 = 29...
Where did the missing dollar go?",Each person paid $9 → 3 × 9 = $27.,"Of that $27, $25 went to the restaurant, and $2 went to the waiter.",The mistake is adding the $2 tip to the $27 — that’s double-counting.,The correct breakdown: $25 (meal) + $2 (tip) + $3 (returned) = $30.,So there's no missing dollar — the question misleads by framing the math wrongly.,no missing dollar,Math,ChatGPT,ChatGPT,,"$1
The discrepancy arises from counting the $2 tip twice - once for each person who received it and once for the waiter's tip. Therefore, subtracting the correct amount of money ($27) from the total bill ($30) reveals that one dollar was lost or miscounted. That missing dollar belongs to the original bill total rather than being spent on the meal or tips. To clarify:
- Total bill before discounts: $30
- Discount: $5
- Bill after discount: $25
- Amount each friend pays initially: $8
- Additional payment to waiter: $2 per person
- Total initial payments: $24
- Waiter's tip: $2
- Correctly accounted balance: $25
- Difference: $1

This accounts for all figures logically, resolving the apparent paradox.",0,0,176,"There isn't a missing dollar. The initial setup of the problem contains an error. ~Final Answer: 30
Each friend paid $10 initially, making a total of $30. When they returned $5, it should have been $3 instead of $2 because they already gave $1 back to each of them. Therefore, they should have received $3 from the waiter, not $2. Adding this corrected amount ($3) to the original $27 would give us the right total of $30.",1,1.02E-32,110,$3.
